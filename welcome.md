# Red Teaming Army

## Welcome

This is my personal blog space. The main idea of this platform is to allow me to share my knowledge in Red Teaming and Penetration Testing. Feel free to use the file navigation in order to view the present blogposts, or use the recursive search to find something specific of your needs!

I will do my best to transfer all of [my videos](https://www.youtube.com/@Lsecqt/videos) to blogposts in order to reach more people.

The Red Teaming Army has its Discord server available here: [https://discord.gg/bgSpdheEgu](https://discord.gg/bgSpdheEgu)

Feel free to join the Discord server, where we share knowledge and experience, while debugging problems in real time!
